# Hi, I'm jamie! Welcome to my website!
Going by Jamie, Skiletro, or just Skil, I use they/them pronouns.

Inspired by the philosophies of the old web while also introducing elements from newer websites, this website is written using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the source code being publically available on [GitHub](https://github.com/skiletro/skiletro.github.io).
The website was finally finished on the 4th of June, 2024.

I'm interested in a whole range of different things; most of which have some sort of connection to technology and the likes.
[Mechanical keyboards](https://github.com/skiletro/vial-qmk/), and [linux ricing](https://github.com/skiletro/nixfiles) are some of my current interests, alongside esports, and just overall just pissing about with things that are *cool*.

## Projects
- [nixfiles](https://github.com/skiletro/nixfiles) ... A Nix flake containing all of my system configuration. I've put a lot of effort into making it look good too.
- [my nix user repository repo](https://github.com/skiletro/nur-repo) ... Not a lot going on here, mostly containing fonts and other small programs. Instead of restricting the packages to my flake, I thought it would be more useful for other people to publish them under the NUR.
- [Simple2FA](https://github.com/skiletro/Simple2FA) ... Written as part of my undergraduate studies, Simple2FA, as the name suggests, is a very basic two-factor authentication app, with support for manual entry as well as scanning QR codes. 
- [Graphics Design Work](https://www.behance.net/skiletro#) ... While I haven't updated the portfolio in a while, I've done quite a lot of work in the graphics design space, creating logos and whatnot. I intend to move this portfolio to this website sometime in the future, but for now all my work happily lives on Behance.
- And more! I honestly can't think of everything off the top of my head, and I'm always doing more stuff so I might update here again soon^
